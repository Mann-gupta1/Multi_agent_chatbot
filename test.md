# Stock Market Chatbot Test Cases

This document outlines test cases to verify the Stock Market Chatbotâ€™s functionality, focusing on stock market queries (prices, historical data, predictions) using an MCP server and client. The chatbot uses a multi-agent system (`coordinator_team.py`) with a mock MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) to handle stock market tools, due to an SDK error. Tests ensure correct agent routing, context inference, and data retrieval from `yfinance` or `stock_market_data.csv`.

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Ensure `stock_market_data.csv` is in `app/data/` with columns: `Date` (MM/DD/YYYY), `Open`, `Close`, and optionally `Symbol`.
2. Start the MCP server:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\manng\OneDrive\Desktop\EI\chatbot\app\agents
   python mcp_server.py
   ```
3. Start PostgreSQL:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\manng\OneDrive\Desktop\EI\chatbot
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```powershell
   streamlit run app\main.py
   ```
5. Access `http://localhost:8501` and input queries via the UI.
6. Clear chat history before tests:
   ```powershell
   psql -U admin -d stock_market_db -c "TRUNCATE TABLE chat_history;"
   ```

**Notes**:
- Outputs use sample `yfinance` data (as of June 18, 2025, 11:48 AM IST) or `stock_market_data.csv`. Actual prices may vary; verify format and agent.
- Predictions use linear regression; exact values depend on historical data.
- Tests assume dependencies from `requirements.txt`, including `modelcontextprotocol`.

## Test Case 1: Current Stock Price
**Purpose**: Verify `GeneralAgent` fetches the latest stock price via MCP (`fetch_stock_price`).
**Input**: "What is the stock price of NVIDIA"
**Expected Output**:
```
135.87

Response by GeneralAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Ensure the price is for NVDA and recent (within 1 day).
- Confirm `GeneralAgent` responds.

---

## Test Case 2: Historical Stock Price
**Purpose**: Verify `GeneralAgent` fetches a historical price via MCP (`fetch_stock_price`).
**Input**: "Stock price of Tesla on 6/10/2025"
**Expected Output**:
```
260.45

Response by GeneralAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Confirm date parsing (06/10/2025).
- Verify price matches `yfinance` for TSLA.
- Ensure `GeneralAgent` responds.

---

## Test Case 3: Historical Data
**Purpose**: Verify `GeneralAgent` fetches historical data via MCP (`fetch_historical_data`).
**Input**: "Historical data for Apple"
**Expected Output**:
```
06/01/2025: Open=$190.10, Close=$192.30
06/02/2025: Open=$192.50, Close=$195.80
...

Response by GeneralAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Check 1-month data for AAPL from `yfinance` or CSV.
- Confirm format (Date, Open, Close).
- Ensure `GeneralAgent` responds.

---

## Test Case 4: Stock Price Prediction
**Purpose**: Verify `GeneralAgent` predicts a price via MCP (`predict_stock_price`).
**Input**: "Predict price of NVIDIA in 5 days"
**Expected Output**:
```
140.22

Response by GeneralAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Confirm prediction for NVDA, 5 days ahead.
- Verify format (USD price).
- Check reasonable value based on NVDA trends.

---

## Test Case 5: Context Inference
**Purpose**: Verify stock symbol inference from chat history.
**Input Sequence**:
1. "What is the stock price of NVIDIA"
2. "Predict price in 3 days"
**Expected Output**:
1. ```
   135.87

   Response by GeneralAgent
   ```
2. ```
   138.50

   Response by GeneralAgent
   ```
**Verification**:
- Confirm second query infers NVDA.
- Ensure `GeneralAgent` responds for both.

---

## Test Case 6: CSV-Based Market Open Price
**Purpose**: Verify `KnowledgeAgent` retrieves open price from `stock_market_data.csv`.
**Input**: "What is the market open price on 4th June"
**Expected Output**:
```
The market open price on June 4, 2025 (assuming 2025) was 18.65.

Response by KnowledgeAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Confirm price matches CSV for June 4, 2025.
- Ensure `KnowledgeAgent` responds.

---

## Test Case 7: Memory Query
**Purpose**: Verify `MemoryAgent` retrieves previous queries.
**Input Sequence**:
1. "What is the stock price of NVIDIA"
2. "What did I ask earlier?"
**Expected Output**:
1. ```
   135.87

   Response by GeneralAgent
   ```
2. ```
   You previously asked:
   - "What is the stock price of NVIDIA"

   Response by MemoryAgent
   ```
**Verification**:
- Confirm second query lists first query.
- Ensure `MemoryAgent` responds.

---

## Test Case 8: Invalid Stock Symbol
**Purpose**: Verify error handling for invalid symbols.
**Input**: "What is the stock price of XYZ"
**Expected Output**:
```
No data for XYZ

Response by GeneralAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Confirm error message.
- Ensure `GeneralAgent` responds.

---

## Test Case 9: Non-Stock-Market Query
**Purpose**: Verify Groq API fallback for non-stock queries.
**Input**: "Who is the CEO of NVIDIA"
**Expected Output**:
```
The CEO of NVIDIA is Jensen Huang.

Response by GeneralAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Confirm Groq API response.
- Ensure `GeneralAgent` responds.

---

## Test Case 10: Ambiguous Query
**Purpose**: Verify handling of ambiguous queries without context.
**Input**: "Stock price" (no prior queries)
**Expected Output**:
```
Please specify a stock symbol (e.g., NVDA, TSLA).

Response by GeneralAgent
```
**Verification**:
- Confirm prompt for symbol.
- Ensure `GeneralAgent` responds.

---

**Post-Test Actions**:
- Check chat history in Streamlit UI.
- Review `mcp_server.py` logs for MCP requests.
- If outputs differ, verify format and agent.
- For errors:
  - Check `yfinance` connectivity.
  - Confirm CSV path (`app/data/stock_market_data.csv`).
  - Update `main.py` for async issues:
    ```python
    import asyncio
    async def process_query(query, uploaded_file):
        team = ReasoningStockTeam()
        return await team.process_query(query, uploaded_file)
    st.session_state.response = asyncio.run(process_query(st.session_state.query, uploaded_file))
    ```
