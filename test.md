## Notes
- **CSV Data**: The `stock_market_data.csv` is assumed to contain data for a single stock/index. If multiple stocks are included, queries should specify a symbol, and the `KnowledgeAgent` would need updating.
- **YFinanceTools**: Outputs for non-CSV queries depend on internet connectivity and API availability.
- **Chat History**: All interactions are stored in PostgreSQL (`stock_market_db.chat_history`) and displayed in the Streamlit UI.
- **Performance**: CSV queries are optimized by loading the file once during `KnowledgeAgent` initialization.
- **Context**: The `GeneralAgent` uses PostgreSQL chat history to infer context (e.g., India for president queries).
- **Edge Cases**: The system handles invalid inputs gracefully, with clear error messages.

Run these tests in the Streamlit app (`http://localhost:8501`) after starting the app with `streamlit run app/main.py` and ensuring PostgreSQL is running (`docker-compose up -d`). Verify that all responses match the expected outputs and are logged in the chat history.
